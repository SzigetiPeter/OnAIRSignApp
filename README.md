# OnAIRSignApp

## Some toughts about the app
Android application to control flash based on registered time slots. 

Let's say you have an old phone, the screen is broken, but it kinda works.
Stick it in a box, slap an *ON AIR* sign on it, adn there you have it.
Instant ON AIR office light. To try to help to keep the office volume down.

## Feature overview
Containing a HTTP server it can turn the flash on and off.

Intended for use ogether with the Desktop client, it can be accessed by IP or using mDNS.
It has a web interface showing the current time table, with registered time slots.

Still lots to do with this one, feel free to contribute.
Intended as a a fun after hours project.
